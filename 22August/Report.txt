## DataFrame:

- Dataframe is something like a excel spreadsheet or a SQL database. Here the data are arranged in a 2 dimensional structure so that it can be manipulated easily.
- One of the most popular dataframe related library is Pandas in Python
- Dataframes are used in cleaning, arranging, and interpreting the data in a much easier way.
- Pandas is one of the way to achieve this

## Data Cleaning:

- Process of correcting, removing errors and inconsistencies in the dataset

Some of them are:

- Missing data → filling in the data with their Mean or Mode
- Outliers → Identifying and removing of the outliers which lie outside of the dataset’s boundaries by using functions
- Normalization → setting the data according to certain formats can make the interpretation of the data easier and accurate
- Duplicates → removing of the redundant data can help in the processing speeds of the data

This can help in improving:

- Accuracy
- Reliability
- Efficiency

## Data Processing:

Data processing is converting raw data into meaningful information using certain operations.

Their stages are:

- Data collection
- Data preparation
- Data input
- Processing
- Data output/interpretation

## EDA:

EDA Stands for **E**xploratory **D**ata **A**nalysis. It is used to summarize the given dataset in a visual way. When data is presented visually, more information can be derived, leading to a more detailed view on the data. This is done using EDA. EDA is done using a few libraries and also a few apps. Some of them are

- Python libraries such as Matplotlib
- Tableau
- Microsoft PowerBi Analytics
