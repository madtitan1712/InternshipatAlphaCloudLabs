Selenium Webdriver:

An API, that can interact and control browsers.

Selenium can manipulate both browsers and automate them. This makes them an ideal choice for testing websites. All elements can be found or be manipulated using their attributes like - Xpath - ID - Name - Class_name - CSS ID

Xpath is something that is used to locate objects on the DOM. Here everything is like an tree based structure, so you can call the children and parent objects easily.
